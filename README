misc modules/templates/snippets

http_async: a must have wrapper around  AnyEvent::HTTP::http_request

SetTheory: the set operations ∪, ∩, -, ^
    ∪ : union                (elements that are both in A or B)
    ∩ : intersection         (elements incommon)
    - : difference           (elements that are members of A but not members of B)
    ^ : symmetric difference (only in A or only in B but not both)

Module: a module template (yeah it is that difficult in Perl :P)

special_literals: those come in handy from time to time
